Hardware Description Language (HDL) designs prototyped on FPGAs are constrained by the devices and interfaces available on the development boards. Most of the constraints are tied to the physical characteristics and not to the logic design. Therefore, the maintenance burden of projects to be tested on multiple boards can be reduced by sharing constraint definition files. This repository provides constraint definitions in a standardised and distributed format, for decoupling board details from design sources. Unlike other similar solutions, these resources are not tied to any specific project management tool.

== Structure of the repository

* `board/`: a subdir for each board
** `.todo/`: a file for each incomplete board
** `<BOARDNAME>`:
*** `info.yml`: board metadata
*** `<CONSTRAINT_FILE(S)>`
* `device/`: a subdir for each device
** `<DEVICENAME>`
*** `info.yml`: device metadata
* `flash/`
** _TBD_
* `sdram/`
** _TBD_
* `template/`: templates for metadata files
** `board.info.yml`
** `device.info.yml`

Types of constraint files:

* Physical Constraints File (`*.pcf`) for Lattice IceCube2.
* Lattice Preference File (`*.lpf`) for Lattice Diamond.
* User Constraint Files (`*.ucf`) for Xilinx ISE â‰¤14.7.
* Xilinx Design Constraints (`*.xdc`) for Xilinx Vivado.
* Synopsis Design Constraints (`*.sdc`) for Intel Quartus Prime (formerly Altera Quartus-II).
* Physical Design Constraints (`*.pdc`) for Microsemi Libero-SoC.

For each board, sets of constraint files are provided according to the following rules:

* Split pin constrains from per IP core timing constrains.
* Group pin constrains per interface/connector (switches, LEDs, Ethernet, UART, etc.). This allows enabling/disabling interfaces by selecting which files to include.
* Use vectors/arrays for unnamed ports, instead of numbering pins individually.
* Prefix each port with the board name.
* If an interface is fixed, include matching timing constraints. E.g. a button with `set_false_path`, `system_clock` with 100 MHz, or GMII with the 2 ns delay.
* Postfix low-active signals with `_n`.

== Usage

This repository is expected to be added as a git submodule or otherwise vendored in existing HDL designs.

The recommended approach is defining one top level source per board, on top of the design's top unit. To avoid ambiguity, we name the former `BoardTop` and the latter `DesignTop`. The purpose of BoardTop is to describe board specific resources (PLLs, DCMs, RAM controllers, etc.) and type/polarity conversions, so that the DesignTop is unmodified for either simulation or implementation, with any tool and/or for any target board.

Responsibilities of a `BoardTop` component/module:

* Normalize low-active signals to high-active signals.
* I/O buffers, if needed.
* Input synchronization.
* Output flip-flops.
* Converting a tristate-bus (I, O, T) to a bi-directional inout signal (and bi-directional buffer).
* Debouncing and maybe edge-detection.

== Contributing

Should you find something wrong, missing or outdated; or if you miss your favourite board/device, you are welcome to contribute! Check the https://github.com/hdl/awesome/issues?q=is%3Aopen[open issues and pull request]. If no one is working on it, let us know and go ahead according to the rules explained above.

== Future work

* Define constraints in YAML files.
* Write generators that export the content to vendor specific formats.
* Write importers that read existing vendor specific constraint files and generate a YAML file.

== References

=== VLSI-EDA/PoC

https://github.com/VLSI-EDA/PoC/[PoC] has a large collection of constraint files for Xilinx ISE/Vivado and Intel/Altera's Quartus-II. The initial commit of this repository imported most of the content from https://github.com/VLSI-EDA/PoC/tree/master/ucf[VLSI-EDA/PoC: ucf/].

=== INTI-CMNB-FPGA/fpga_lib

https://github.com/INTI-CMNB-FPGA/fpga_lib[fpga_lib] contains some YAML files that use a custom format: https://github.com/INTI-CMNB-FPGA/fpga_lib/tree/master/boards[INTI-CMNB-FPGA/fpga_lib: boards/]. A Python script (https://github.com/INTI-CMNB-FPGA/fpga_lib/blob/master/scripts/boardfiles.py[boardfiles.py]) allows generating UCF files from the YAML sources.

=== eine/vhdl-cfg

Constraints files (`.pcf` and `.lpf`) for open source boards were picked from https://github.com/eine/vhdl-cfg/[vhdl-cfg], which are based on resources from https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin[ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin], https://github.com/antonblanchard/ghdl-yosys-blink[antonblanchard/ghdl-yosys-blink], https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-workshop[im-tomu/fomu-workshop], etc.

=== litex-hub/litex-boards

https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards[litex-boards] is equivalent to this repository, but constraints are defined as Python modules. It'd be interesting to allow conversions between the YAML and LiteX board definitions. At the same time, from LiteX definitions it should be possible to generate vendor constraint files matching the guidelines.

=== nmigen/nmigen-boards

https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen-boards[nmigen/nmigen-boards] provides board and connector definition files for nMigen. It is also equivalent to this repository, but constraints are defined as Python modules. As with litex-boards, it'd be interesting to allow conversions between the YAML and nMigen board definitions. The syntax used in nmigen-boards feels more streamlined.

=== SymbiFlow/yosys-symbiflow-plugins

https://github.com/SymbiFlow/yosys-symbiflow-plugins[yosys-symbiflow-plugins] contains plugins for Yosys developed as part of the https://github.com/SymbiFlow[SymbiFlow] project. Some of those plugins are the `xdc-plugin` or the `sdc-plugin`. Those take the constraints and information and converts them to annotations on RTL. Annotations can also be directly provided in HDL too. Hence, the aim is to collect everything into the RTL and then write the data back for downstream tools to use. The main benefit of this approach is using the names in RTL, instead of dealing with mangled names after optimisation.

=== olofk/fusesoc

https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc[fusesoc] proposes an open source YAML format for defining cores. Hence, the constrains provided in this repository are expected to be used in those core definition sources. Ideally, fusesoc might import the YAML definition, instead of defining different filesets for each tool.

=== Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore

The board data files used with Xilinx Vivado are hosted at https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore[Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore]. The upstream of https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore/tree/master/boards/Digilent[Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore: boards/Digilent/] is https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-boards[Digilent/vivado-boards].
